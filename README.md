## Rails Weather API Retriever

This is a rails app that takes a city/state as input and will retrieve current weather, along with weather for the next week.

Currently, on invalid input (unfound city/state combination), the form will default to Sacramento, CA.

You can find the Weather API wrapper in ``lib/weather.rb``
